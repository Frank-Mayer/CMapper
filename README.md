# ClassInk

With this online UML Class-Diagram-Editor you can save time, drawing it all by yourself.

The tool is focused on simplicity.

You can send it to a printer, export it as a image, save as a file for offline use or send the link. Offline use is avaliable with the Windows App (installer at GitHub Releases).
